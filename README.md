## 🌍 Vision

The world’s most important places should not be locked behind borders, tickets, or limitations.

ONLIVE is building a decentralized ecosystem that digitizes monuments, stadiums, museums, and cultural landmarks in immersive 3D and VR.

The ON Token is the economic engine powering that vision.
